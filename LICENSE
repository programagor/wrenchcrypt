wrenchcrypt costs nothing, unless you are a non-humanitarian government organisation or commercial entity. You may run wrenchcrypt for your own personal use, human rights or community group activities or for non-defense related academic research.

If you want to use the program in a commercial setting, you need to seek a license. If you work for a state security agency, spy agency, military or defense organisation you must also seek a license before using this program.
